This is a suggestion for an effort to collaborate on something much bigger that could be both for a "social club", seed-saving and open-source breeding, grow journals for growers to act as testers for breeders (or simply record entries into a grow journal for each plant. I've already deascribed some of the fearures, elsewhere and ideas for how I'd build it out. I'll share some of them here and email to discuss collaboration and strategy, etc.
